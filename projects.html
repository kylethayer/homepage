    <h2>Coding Bootcamps</h2>
    <p>
        I studied the barriers faced by students in coding bootcamps. This work involved interviewing 26 coding bootcamp students.

    <h2>Color Perception Test</h2>
    <p>
        This project has two components: the test, and the experiment being run on the test.
    </p>
    <h4>The Test</h4>
        <p>
            <a href="http://labinthewild.org/studies/color_perception/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" src="http://labinthewild.org/images/color_perception_english_only_wide.png" alt="Color Perception Test logo (image of crayons)" width="150" height="100" /></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            How does your color perception compares to others? Performing color sorting and color naming tasks to find out! This experiment takes around 12 minutes.

        </p>
    <h4>The Experiment</h4>
        <p>
            The Color Perception Test is currently gathering data on how people perceive and name colors in different languages. 
            The test is part of <a href="http://www.labinthewild.org/">LabintheWild</a>, 
            an online experiment platform for conducting behavioral studies that lets participants compare themselves to others in exchange for study participation.
        </p>
    <h4>Results</h4>

    This is an independent project I made because I wanted to be able to navigate through evolutionary changes in a way I didn't find on other websites. 
    In particular, I wanted to see something closer to the individual gradual steps by which animals evolved (as far as we can tell). 
    For example, I wanted to be able to start at a <a href="https://kylethayer.github.io/bioladder/#Gray%20whale" target="_blank">whale</a> and navigate my way back to see where whales came from.

    This project was done as part of my Master's Thesis research and was used to visualize and analyze Flow Cytometry Data from human cells.

    <h2>3D Reconstruction of Greek Ruins at Samothrace</h2>
    <p>
        While I was at Emory University I worked with <a href="http://arthistory.emory.edu/home/people/faculty/wescoat.html" target="_blank">Bonna Wescoat</a> of the Emory Art History department along with others on a 3D reconstruction of the ruins at Samothrace, Greece.

        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samothrace_temple_complex" target="_blank">Sanctuary of the Great Gods</a> was the site of the one of the most famous of the Mystery Religions in ancient Greece and had famous members, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Macedon" target="_blank">Philip II</a> (father of Alexander the Great). The Sanctuary of the Great Gods was also the home of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winged_Victory_of_Samothrace" target="_blank">Nike of Samothrace</a> statue (now in the Louvre).
